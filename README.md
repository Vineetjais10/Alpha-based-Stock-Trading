## Alpha-Based Trading Strategy with Static Thresholds
# Overview
This project involves the creation and optimization of an alpha-based trading strategy using static thresholds. The strategy calculates returns and optimizes trading performance through a backtesting engine, enabling accurate calculation of profit and loss (PnL). We utilized a simple grid search to optimize thresholds, resulting in improved returns.
